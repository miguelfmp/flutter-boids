# Flutter Boids

Based on the model by Craig Reynolds of 1986 http://www.red3d.com/cwr/boids/. 
This model intends to create flocking behaviours that can be used in different animal behaviours (fish, birds, bats).
The application intends to prove that Flutter can not only be used to create UI/UX but also more complex simulations with AI and games.

## Getting started

Extract the files to any folder. Inside the folder run the following command on a console: "flutter run --release" for release or for debug: "flutter run". Both commands were only tested on an android device.
When running the app simply tap to add more boids. There is no limit of boids as it will be depended of the hardware limitations. On a low/medium spec phone it was capable of running 200 boids.
